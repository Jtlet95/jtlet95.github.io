// CONTROL FLOW
//in javascript we can controll the flow or order of which our data is executed at 
//with condiontal statments, the computer will start at the top of the statment 
// 1. IF (condition) so at the top we start with an if statment IF something is true 
// excute this action if not it will look through the next statment 
//2.ElSE IF (condition) now that that computer has some more data to look over 
// it will check if this condition is true and run this instead HOWEVER you can
// have many else if conditions to test diffrenet conditions within your code
// at once 
// 3.ELSE this is if none of the above statments returned a a needed condition 
// i think of the else statment as the however statment if non of the code above
// was what was need to run that code block then run THIS code block instead 
//    EXAMPLE
    //   if(2 > 1){
    //     console.log("its happining")
    //  } else if {
    //     console.log("im not sure about that")
    //  }else if{
    //      console.log("thats not greater than")
    //  }else console.log("im to tired to check")
    
//     if (condition) {
//   statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
//   statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
// } else {
//   statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
//   statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;
// }
