// LOOPS 
//1.loops have been created in the javascript language to execute a block of code 
// a number of times its way more convient then writting out a block of code 
//ten, twenty or a hundred times there are three loops that i am going to 
// discus in the following section for loops, for in loops, while loops 
//all loops have a starting condition a stopping condition and increment or
// deincriment 
// EX: for loops,    
//for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    //console.log("Hello Moto")
//};
//so the for loop is saying while i is less than 5 print to the console"Hello Moto"
//until the starting condition has met the stopping condition 

//  EX: for in loop (looping over an object)
  // for(var key in object){
    //   console.log(key);
      // console.log(object[key])
  // };
   // the for in loop allows us to loop through the values of objects and with 
   //each itteration of the loop the vlaue of the next property is assigned to
   // the variable 
   
 //EX while loops (while something is true loop)
 //var count = 0;
 //while(count < 5){
   //  console.log(count);
     //count ++
 //}
 // the  while loops allow us to loop while a condition is true so it will 
 // itterate until the count is no longer less than 5 
 
 //LOOPS can also count backwards or deincriment 
  //for(var i = 10 ; i <= 0; i--){
    //  console.log(i)
  //}
  
  // LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY 
  // let exampArr= [];
  // for(var i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
 //        exampArr.push();
 //}
  //   return exampArr => this must be done outside the loop or it will stop on
  // the first iteration
